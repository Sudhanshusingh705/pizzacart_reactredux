        <p >The first pizza is believed to have been created in the 18th century in a port town called Napoli, which is now known as Naples.

          At that time, it was customary for people who lived on the streets and didn’t have a lot of money to put whatever they could find onto some dough.

          Because of this, people began putting things like garlic, oil, salt and basil onto their dough to season it before eating. This dish became known as ‘pizza’.
